# Personal Financial Manager
Personal financial manager (PFM) is a tool for personal financial management.
I am going to add basic features (e.g. income and expense registration and tracking) as well as advanced features such as cashflow management and budget management.

## Roadmap
- PFM is going to be a simple expense and income tracking app.
- Then future expense management (e.g. loans or rents) will be added.
- Cashflow management will enrich the experience.
- Then I will add budget management tool.
- Then I will try to enance web-application features such as offline work.
- I may try for .apk compilation!

Stay tuned!
